Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems. 
Software engineering is important in the tech industry by enabling the creationof softwareapplications and systems that power various aspects of modern life

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Developmnt of programming languages, the establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s and the rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements: is the gathering and documenting userneeds and system requirements
Design: is the phase where high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface are created
Implimentation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specification
Testing: Conduct various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements
Deployment: Is the phase where the software is released to the clients or users
Maintenance: Providing support, updates and enhancements to the software after deployment

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodologies uses linear and sequential approach while agile methodologies use iterative and incremental apprach
Example of Waterfall methodologies include Manufacturing processes e.g assembly line production 
Example of Agile methodologies include

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer: is responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions
Quality asssurance Engineer: Ensures spftware quality by designing and executing test plans
Project manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs are software packages that provide complete tools for writing, debugging and testings codes. Examples are Netbeans, Visual studio
VCS are software tools that are used to track changes in source code 

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Tight deadlines
Technical Debt
Changing requirements

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing is the yesying of individual components or modules of a software
Integration testing: it tests different components 
Axxeptance Testing: tests the entire software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Engineering is about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible response from AI models. It helps the AI understands exactly what we need by avoiding vague questions

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Tell me about computers
tell me about the revolution of computers from inception to the current models we have nowadays

The eimproved prompt is necessary so as to get a concise response from AI
